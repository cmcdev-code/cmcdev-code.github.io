## Hiiiiii!

This is my new and improved *static* website. My old one is here [cmcdev.org], but I no longer have access to it.

I recently completed my bachelor's degree in Mathematics at Virginia Tech and have now begun my master's in Applied Data Science at the University of Chicago. This summer, I have been working as a software engineering intern at Translogistics. In my free time, I have been reading various books.

I just finished [*An Introduction to Probabilistic Modeling*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-1046-7). I attempted it last summer but didn’t yet have the analysis background required, so it was exciting to revisit it this year after completing my analysis sequence. Now I’m working through *[Algebraic Foundations for Applied Topology and Data Analysis](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-06664-1)*. I’m enjoying it so far—it’s fun to revisit concepts from my abstract algebra class, like [localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization_(commutative_algebra)), while also learning about new topics such as [vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_bundle).

After I finish this book (in about a month), I plan to start another on [topological data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis), as well as one I picked up on sale: [*Large-Scale Convex Optimization via Monotone Operators*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/largescale-convex-optimization/2A7F8E7428BFA4EDB8AFACA11AB97E4C). I’m still exploring my research interests, and right now I’m leaning toward either convex optimization or TDA, but we’ll see where things go.
