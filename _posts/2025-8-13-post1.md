I'm giving a detailed accounting of my day so far. I think it'll be funny to look back on.

**Breakfast**  
Went to [Nudy's Cafe](https://www.nudyscafes.com). I ordered the *Lox & Cream Cheese Omelet* (from the [breakfast menu](https://www.nudyscafes.com/breakfast)), plus a black coffee, iced water, and rye toast. 

Then I went to work.

**Lunch**  
Returned to [Nudy's Cafe](https://www.nudyscafes.com) and got the *“Best Ever” Carrot Cake French Toast* (also on the [breakfast menu](https://www.nudyscafes.com/breakfast)), two eggs sunny-side up, and bacon. The French toast was quite good 8/10.

**Afternoon**  
I finished the image processing using the OpenAI API for OCR on some documents, which was nice.

**Evening**  
I FaceTimed Erin for 64 minutes. Then I took the online assessment for [Chicago Trading Company](https://www.chicagotrading.com)—I think I did pretty well.

Now I'm reading this paper: [ScienceDirect article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045782525004116).

That's my day. :)
